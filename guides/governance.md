# Governance Model

This guide outlines a governance model for maintaining the Snowflake Model Context Protocol (MCP) as an organizational standard.

## Governance Structure

### Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|-----------------|
| **MCP Owner** | Strategic oversight, approving major changes, alignment with org goals |
| **Template Curators** | Reviewing template updates, ensuring quality and consistency |
| **Domain Experts** | Subject matter input for domain-specific templates |
| **User Representatives** | Providing feedback based on practical usage |

### Decision-Making Process

1. **Proposal** - Any team member can propose changes or new templates
2. **Review** - Template curators evaluate proposals for quality and alignment
3. **Testing** - Changes are tested with a subset of users
4. **Approval** - Final approval by MCP Owner before official release
5. **Release** - Templates are published with version and release notes

## Maintenance Lifecycle

### Regular Reviews

- Conduct quarterly reviews of template effectiveness
- Check for alignment with current Snowflake features and best practices
- Update templates based on evolving organizational needs

### Version Control

- Use semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch)
- Maintain a changelog for all template changes
- Archive outdated templates rather than deleting them

### Quality Metrics

Evaluate templates based on:

- **Adoption rate** - Percentage of users using the template
- **Feedback score** - User ratings on template effectiveness
- **Success rate** - Percentage of successful query outcomes
- **Efficiency** - Time saved compared to non-templated approaches

## Managing Template Evolution

### Balancing Stability and Innovation

- **Stable Core** - Maintain stable core templates with backward compatibility
- **Experimental Branch** - Allow for experimental templates for new approaches
- **Feedback Loop** - Use production data to inform template improvements

### Deprecation Policy

1. **Announce deprecation** at least one quarter before retirement
2. **Provide migration path** to newer templates
3. **Support transition period** with documentation
4. **Archive deprecated templates** for reference

## Communication Strategy

### Keeping Users Informed

- **Release announcements** for new templates and major updates
- **Documentation updates** with examples of effective usage
- **Success stories** showcasing benefits of template usage
- **Office hours** for questions and advanced usage guidance

### Collecting Feedback

- **Regular surveys** on template effectiveness
- **User interviews** for in-depth feedback
- **Usage analytics** to identify patterns and pain points
- **Suggestion box** for continuous improvement ideas

## Training and Enablement

- **Onboarding materials** for new users
- **Advanced workshops** for template customization
- **Champion network** to provide peer support
- **Certification program** for MCP experts
