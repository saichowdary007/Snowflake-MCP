# Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you get started using the Snowflake Model Context Protocol (MCP) with AI assistants.

## Choosing the Right Template

1. **For Basic Queries** - Use the [minimal template](../templates/minimal.md)
2. **For Debugging** - Use the [debugging template](../templates/debugging.md)
3. **For Performance Optimization** - Use the [optimization template](../templates/optimization.md)
4. **For Visualization/Dashboards** - Use the [visualization template](../templates/visualization.md)
5. **For Comprehensive Assistance** - Use the [complete template](../templates/complete.md)

## Steps to Use MCP

1. **Copy the template** - Select the appropriate template based on your needs
2. **Fill in the relevant sections** - You don't need to complete every section, just focus on what's relevant
3. **Include the filled template** when asking an AI assistant for help with your SQL query

## Example Workflow

1. You encounter a slow-performing Snowflake query
2. Copy the [optimization template](../templates/optimization.md)
3. Fill in:
   - Your query
   - The table structures
   - Current performance metrics
   - Your performance goals
4. Send this to your AI assistant with a request like: "Help me optimize this Snowflake query using the context provided"

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific** about what you're trying to achieve
- **Include sample data** where possible
- **Provide error messages** exactly as they appear
- **Specify your environment** (Snowflake edition, compute resources, etc.)

## Next Steps

- Check out the [implementation guide](implementation.md) for organization-wide deployment
- View [real-world examples](../examples/) to see MCP in action
- Learn how to [customize templates](customization.md) for your specific needs
