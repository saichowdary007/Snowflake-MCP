# Complex Query Example Using Comprehensive MCP Template

## Problem Statement

A data scientist needs help with a complex customer segmentation analysis that combines transaction history, customer demographics, product categories, and time-based patterns to identify high-value customer segments for a targeted marketing campaign.

## Filled Template

```markdown
# Comprehensive Snowflake MCP Template

## 1. QUERY CONTEXT

### Business Context
We need to develop a sophisticated customer segmentation model based on purchase behavior, demographics, and engagement patterns. The marketing team will use these segments for an upcoming personalized campaign that aims to increase repeat purchases from our highest value customers while reactivating dormant customers with high potential.

### Query Objective
Create a comprehensive customer segmentation query that categorizes customers into 5 distinct segments:
1. VIP (high spend, frequent purchases)
2. High Potential (moderate spend but increasing trend)
3. At Risk (declining engagement)
4. Dormant (previously active but no recent purchases)
5. New (customers who joined in the last 60 days)

### User Skill Level
Intermediate - I understand advanced SQL concepts but need help with optimizing complex window functions and cohort analysis.

## 2. DATABASE STRUCTURE

### Schema Definitions
```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(100),
  signup_date DATE,
  birth_year INTEGER,
  gender VARCHAR(20),
  zip_code VARCHAR(10),
  acquisition_source VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
  transaction_id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
  transaction_date TIMESTAMP,
  total_amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  payment_method VARCHAR(50),
  store_id INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE transaction_items (
  item_id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
  transaction_id VARCHAR(36) REFERENCES transactions(transaction_id),
  product_id INTEGER,
  quantity INTEGER,
  unit_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  discount_amount DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  product_name VARCHAR(100),
  category_id INTEGER,
  sub_category_id INTEGER,
  base_price DECIMAL(10,2),
  brand_id INTEGER
);

CREATE TABLE customer_engagement (
  engagement_id VARCHAR(36) PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INTEGER REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
  engagement_date TIMESTAMP,
  channel VARCHAR(50),
  action VARCHAR(50),
  session_duration_seconds INTEGER
);
```

### Table Statistics
```
-- Approximate row counts and sizes
-- customers: ~500K rows, 200MB
-- transactions: ~5M rows, 2GB
-- transaction_items: ~15M rows, 5GB
-- products: ~10K rows, 10MB
-- customer_engagement: ~30M rows, 10GB
```

### Constraints and Indexes
```
-- customers is clustered by signup_date
-- transactions is clustered by transaction_date
-- products has a secondary index on category_id and sub_category_id
-- customer_engagement is clustered by engagement_date
```

## 3. CURRENT QUERY

```sql
-- This is my current attempt, but it's not working correctly
WITH customer_purchase_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    c.signup_date,
    c.acquisition_source,

LEFT JOIN engagement_metrics em ON cpm.customer_id = em.customer_id
ORDER BY cpm.total_spend DESC;
```

## 4. QUERY ISSUES (if applicable)

### Error Messages
```
-- No error messages, but the results don't look right
```

### Performance Issues
- Current execution time: ~6 minutes
- Target execution time: <2 minutes
- Query profile metrics: The JOIN between transactions and transaction_items is taking the most time

### Logic Issues
- The segmentation logic doesn't capture spending trend (increasing or decreasing) over time
- New customers with high initial spend are not properly classified
- The 'At Risk' category should consider both recency and frequency trend, not just recency
- Not considering product category preferences in segmentation

## 10. PREVIOUS ATTEMPTS

```sql
-- Previously tried calculating a spending trend but it was too slow
WITH monthly_spending AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_date) AS month,
    SUM(total_amount) AS monthly_spend
  FROM transactions
  GROUP BY 1, 2
),
customer_trend AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    REGR_SLOPE(monthly_spend, DATEDIFF(month, FIRST_VALUE(month) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY month), month)) AS spend_trend
  FROM monthly_spending
  GROUP BY customer_id
)
-- This approach wasn't efficient for large datasets
```
```

## Request to AI Assistant

"I need help with this complex customer segmentation query. I want to improve both the logic of my segmentation criteria and the performance of the query. Can you review my current attempt and suggest a more sophisticated approach that incorporates spending trends and product preferences while being more efficient?"

## AI Assistant Response

I've analyzed your segmentation approach and identified improvements for both the logic and performance. Here's a revised query:

### Key Improvements:

1. **Better Segmentation Logic**:
   - VIP now requires consistent or increasing spending patterns
   - High Potential identifies both established customers with increasing trends and new customers with high initial spend
   - At Risk captures both recency issues and negative spending trends
   - All logic uses a standardized date reference table for clarity

2. **Spending Trend Analysis**:
   - Compares most recent 3 months with previous 9 months
   - Annualizes the rates for fair comparison
   - Accounts for new spenders vs. established customers

3. **Product Preferences**:
   - Identifies each customer's top product category
   - Could be expanded to include product diversity score

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Pre-calculating date ranges once
   - Limiting the transaction history to 12 months
   - Using window functions efficiently
   - Pre-filtering before joins
   - Selecting only needed columns from large tables

5. **Engagement Score**:
   - Combines recency and depth of engagement
   - Normalized to a 0-100 scale for easy interpretation

6. **Added Order By**:
   - Orders results by segment priority and total spend
   - Makes the output immediately useful for marketing prioritization

This query addresses all your requirements while improving performance. For further optimization, consider materializing the date ranges and customer purchase metrics in temporary tables if your Snowflake environment allows it.

## Key Takeaways

1. The comprehensive template provided all the necessary context for a complex query optimization
2. Detailing the business context helped ensure the segmentation logic aligned with business goals
3. Including previous attempts prevented repeating unsuccessful approaches
4. Explaining performance issues highlighted specific areas for optimization
